# BookStore - MERN Stack Project Summary
Description:
The BookStore application is a full-stack web platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It allows users to browse, purchase, and manage books online, with features tailored for both customers and administrators.

This project is open for collaboration! Developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts are welcome to contribute and enhance the platform together.

Book Details Page: Detailed descriptions, reviews, and ratings for each book.
Cart Management: Add, remove, and view items in the shopping cart.
Checkout Flow: A user-friendly interface for placing orders, including address and payment information.

# # Backend (Node.js + Express.js):
API Development: RESTful APIs for handling book data, user management, and orders.
Admin Features: Manage books, inventory, and view sales reports.
Order Processing: Handle order creation, updates, and status tracking.
Security: Hashing of passwords and secure data transfer.

Orders: Tracks orders placed by users, including items, payment status, and delivery updates.

# # Dockerization
Docker Setup
The entire project is containerized using Docker to ensure consistency and portability across environments.

# # Frontend (React.js):
Dockerfile:
```
FROM node:20-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 5173

CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

# # Build & Run Commands:
```
docker build -t frontend .
docker run --name frontend -d -p 5173:5173 frontend
```

# # Backend (Node.js + Express.js):
Dockerfile:
```
node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3333

CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

# # Build & Run Commands:

```
docker build -t backend .
docker run --name backend -d -p 3333:3333 backend
```
# # Database (MongoDB):

Run MongoDB using Docker:
```
docker run --name mongodb --network=mern-stack -d -p 27017:27017 -v ~/opt/data:/data/db mongo:latest
Docker Compose
To streamline the process, a docker-compose.yml file combines all services:
```


```
version: '3.8'
services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "5173:5173"
    depends_on:
      - backend

  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
    ports:
      - "3333:3333"
    depends_on:
      - database

  database:
    image: mongodb
    container_name: bookstore-mongodb
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
```
